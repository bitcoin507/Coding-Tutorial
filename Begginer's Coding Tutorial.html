        <p>
            I will attempt to make this guide as simple and intuititive as possible. 
            The goal is to enable you to start coding right away and use the K.I.S.S method (Keep It Simple Stupid).
            I will be using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Some times I will break it into sections but I will also teach how I would create awebpage step by step and show what tools I use and how I use them.
