        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            I will attempt to make this guide as simple and intuititive as possible.
            The goal is to enable you to start coding right away and use the K.I.S.S method (Keep It Simple Stupid).
            I will be using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Some times I will break it into sections but I will also teach how I
            would create awebpage step by step and show what tools I use and how I use them.

        <h2>Basic Layout and Formatting</h2>
        <p>
             I will first describe the basic layout of a webpage and how to format it. I will then describe the elements and tags that are used in HTML.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Create an HTML template
        </h3>
        <p>
            I will be using the Visual Studio Code editor. I will be using the HTML Boilerplate extension to create a template for my HTML file.
            <br></br>
            Open Visual Studio Code and create a new file. Save the file as "index.html". 
            <br></br>
                To create a basic HTML all we need to do is type ! and hit enter. This will create a basic HTML template.Try it out.

        </p>
        <h3>
            Divs and containers
        </h3>
        <p>
            A div  is a type of container tag.Container tags are tags that have some content between their opening and closing tags.A div is a generic tag that we use to organize our content.We can then assign an ID or class to the div to help us identify it and style it.We will do this in an external CSS stylesheet.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Boxes
        </h3>
        <p>
            It may help to think of a webpage as a box with other boxes inside of it. The boxes can be nested inside of each other. The boxes can be styled with CSS.Next we will look at some examples. 
            <br></br>
            Create a div and assign it an id of box1
        </p>
        
            &lt;div id="box1"&gt

            </div>
