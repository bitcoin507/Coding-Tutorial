        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            I will attempt to make this guide as simple and intuititive as possible.
            The goal is to enable you to start coding right away and use the K.I.S.S method (Keep It Simple Stupid).
            I will be using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Some times I will break it into sections but I will also teach how I
            would create awebpage step by step and show what tools I use and how I use them.

        <h2>Basic Layout and Formatting</h2>
        <p>
             I will first describe the basic layout of a webpage and how to format it. I will then describe the elements and tags that are used in HTML.
        </p>

        <h3>Create an HTML template</h3>
        <p>
            I will be using the Visual Studio Code editor. I will be using the HTML Boilerplate extension to create a template for my HTML file.
            <br></br>
            Open Visual Studio Code and create a new file. Save the file as "index.html". 
            <br></br>
                To create a basic HTML all we need to do is type ! and hit enter. This will create a basic HTML template.Try it out.

        <h3>Divs and containers</h3>
        <p>
            A div  is a type of container tag.Container tags are tags that have some content between their opening and closing tags.A div is a generic tag that we use to organize our content.We can then assign an ID or class to the div to help us identify it and style it.We will do this in an external CSS stylesheet.

        <h3>Boxes</h3>
        <p>
            It may help to think of a webpage as a box with other boxes inside of it. The boxes can be nested inside of each other. The boxes can be styled with CSS.Next we will look at some examples. 
            <br></br>
            Create a div and assign it an id of container.
        </p>
        
            &lt;div id="container"&gt &lt;/div &gt

            

            <div class="container">
            <div class="blue box"></div>
            <div class="purple box"></div>
            <div class="red box"></div>
            <div class="green box"></div>
            </div>
            

            <p>
                Note that nothing will appear on the rendered page yet. We need to set some style atributes in our CSS file first.
                <br></br>
                First lets set the dimentions of our box using the "width" and "height" properties.
                <br></br>

                
            </p>
            <p>
                If you are a visual learner it may help to create a template layout first and name all of the page elements.
            </p>
            <p>
                Lets create some additional boxes and explore the position properties.
                &lt;div id="box2"&gt &lt;/div &gt  &lt;div id="box3"&gt &lt;/div &gt &lt;div id="box4"&gt &lt;/div &gt
                Assign each box different propeties in the CSS stylesheet.

            <h3>
                Positioning 
            </h3>
            <p>
                Now lets look at how we can use the positions attributes in our CSS sheet to arrange our boxes on the page.

                <ul>
                    <li>Static: The element is positioned according to the normal flow of the document. The top, right, bottom, left, and z-index properties have no effect. This is the default value.
                    </li> <br></br>

                    <li>Relative: The element is positioned according to the normal flow of the document. When we move it or offset the element it is moved relative to is original position.So if we indicate top 40 px it will move the element DOWN 40px.Another to picture it is that the new position of the top of the element will be 40 px awayfrom where it was originally.If we indicate left 20px it will move the element 20px to the RIGHT of its original position. The offset does not affect the position of any other elements; thus, the space given for the element in the page layout is the same as if position were static.
                    </li> <br></br>

                    <li>Absolute:The element is removed from the normal document flow, and no space is created for the element in the page layout. It is positioned relative to its closest positioned ancestor, if any; otherwise, it is placed relative to the initial containing block. Its final position is determined by the values of top, right, bottom, and left.
                    </li> <br></br>

                    <li>Fixed:The element is removed from the normal document flow, and no space is created for the element in the page layout. It is positioned relative to the initial containing block established by the viewport, which means it always stays in the same place even if the page is scrolled.
                    </li> <br></br>

                    <li>Sticky:The element is positioned according to the normal flow of the document, and then offset relative to its nearest scrolling ancestor and containing block.</li> <br></br>
                </ul>

                    <p class="bold">
                        To sum up:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            A relatively positioned element is an element whose computed position value is relative. The top and bottom properties specify the vertical offset from its normal position; the left and right properties specify the horizontal offset.
                        </li> <br></br>
                        <li>
                            An absolutely positioned element is an element whose computed position value is absolute or fixed. The top, right, bottom, and left properties specify offsets from the edges of the element's containing block. (The containing block is the ancestor relative to which the element is positioned.) If the element has margins, they are added to the offset.
                        </li> <br></br>
                        <li>
                            A stickily positioned element is an element whose computed position value is sticky. It's treated as relatively positioned until its containing block crosses a specified threshold.
                        </li> <br></br>
                    </ul>
                    
                 <br></br>
                Play around with the CSS position atributes in the stylesheet to get used familiarize yourself with the efects they have.There is a lot of information on the web about the position atributes and how they work. We will explore more of them in the future.

            <h3>Semantic elements</h3>
            <p>
                Now lets have a look at semantic elements and see how they can help us organize our content. A semantic element clearly describes its meaning to both the browser and the developer.
                Below are some examples of semantic elements.

                
                <div id="table-con">
                <table>

                     <th>
                        Tag
                     </th>
                     <th>
                        Description 
                     </th>
                     </tr>
                    
                    <tr>

                            </li> 
                            </ul>

                <h3>
                    Format a page using semantic HTML elements
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Lets create some of the most common semantic HTML elements and style them so that they are visable to get a better idea of page layout.
                    <br></br>
                    For our basic layout we will use the following tags.
                    &lt;header &gt;;&lt;nav &gt;;&lt;section &gt;;&lt;article &gt;;
                    &lt;aside &gt;;&lt;footer &gt;
                </p>
                <div id="pageLayout">
                    <header id="sampleHeader">
                        <h1>
                            Sample Header
                        </h1>

                    </header>
                    <nav>
                        <a href="#" >Email</a>
                        <a href="#">LinkedIn</a>
                        <a href="#">Git Hub</a>
                        <a href="#">Twitter</a>
                    </nav>
                    <section id="sampleSection">
                        <h3>Sample Section</h3>
                    </section>
                    <article id="sampleArticle">
                        <h3>Sample Article</h3>
                    </article>
                    <aside id="sampleAside">
                        <h3>Sample Aside</h3>
                    </aside>
                    <footer id="sampleFooter">
                        <h3>Sample Footer</h3>
                    </footer>

                </div>

                Other than styling them with a border and background-color to give a  visual representation of the layout of each element and giving the content of the header center-align property, we have not done any additionl styling. This is how the elements will appear in the page layout. They are all block elements; if we add content inside of the parent element they will expand to allow room.
                <aside>
                    <h3>
                        Block elements
                    </h3>
                    A block-level element always starts on a new line, and the browsers automatically add some space (a margin) before and after the element.

A block-level element always takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).Notice how the header element was automatically cntered.
                    <h3>
                        Display Inline vs Display Inline Block
                    </h3>
                   Compared to display: inline, the major difference is that display: inline-block allows to set a width and height on the element.

Also, with display: inline-block, the top and bottom margins/paddings are respected, but with display: inline they are not.

Compared to display: block, the major difference is that display: inline-block does not add a line-break after the element, so the element can sit next to other elements.

                   <h3>
                    Example
                   </h3>

                   <div>

                   <h1>The display Property</h1>

<h2>display: inline</h2>

                </aside>
            </article>
            

            <article>
                <h3>
                    Sample page Layout
                </h3>

                Now we will use the semantic HTML elements again but this time lets add some more styles and try to make a clean page layout. We wilcontinue to use borders and background color for visual clarity.I find that making a mock layout on a sheet of paper or computer program helps.

                <div id="pageLayout2">
                    <header id="sampleHeader2">
                        <h1>
                            Sample Header
                        </h1>

                    </header>
                    <nav id="nav2">
                        <a class="navLink" href="#" >Email</a>
                        <a class="navLink" href="#">LinkedIn</a>
                        <a class="navLink" href="#">Git Hub</a>
                        <a class="navLink" href="#">Twitter</a>
                    </nav>
                    <section id="sampleSection2">
                        <h3>Sample Section</h3>
                    </section>
                    <article id="sampleArticle2">
                        <h3>Sample Article</h3>
                    </article>
                    <aside id="sampleAside2">
                        <h3>Sample Aside</h3>
                    </aside>
                    <footer id="sampleFooter2">
                        <h3>Sample Footer</h3>
                    </footer>

                </div>
            </article>
            <p>
                We just used position relative style all of the boxes previously.We can also set the parent container to relative and the child boxes to absolute.Lets try.
            </p>

            <div id="pageLayout3">
                    <header id="sampleHeader3">
                        <h1>
                            Sample Header
                        </h1>

                    </header>
                    <nav id="nav3">
                        <a class="navLink" href="#" >Email</a>

                        <a class="navLink" href="#">Git Hub</a>
                        <a class="navLink" href="#">Twitter</a>
                    </nav>
                    <section id="sampleSection3">
                        <h3>Sample Section</h3>
                    </section>
                    <article id="sampleArticle3">
                        <h3>Sample Article</h3>
                    </article>
                    <aside id="sampleAside3">
                        <h3>Sample Aside</h3>
                    </aside>
                    
                    <footer id="sampleFooter3">
                        <h3>Sample Footer</h3>
                    </footer>

                </div>
                <article>
                    <h3>Flex Boxes</h3> 

                    <p>We can set a parent item or container or box to have a display propert of Flex, this creates a Flexbox and all of the child elements inside will become flex items. We can set certain properties to our Flex container that will control the layout of the flex items it contains.This helps automate much of the manual layout we diid using the position property.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If we create a div container with child items the child items will be block elements and eah one will take up a seperate line as we learned.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Let's create a Flex Container and  set width, hieght, border,and background color properties. We will also create 4 Flex items and set a min height,width, border and background color to make it easy to visualize everything.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Now we can see that our flex items are laid out along the X axis or in a row. With display flex the default behaviour is that all flex items are laid out in a row. We can change this by assigning the flex direction property to our Flex container to column.There are 2 axis we use for Flexbox to position and layout our flexbox items, we dont call them the x and y axis but the main axis and the cross axis.For rows the main axis runs horizontially and the cross axis runs vertically. Columns are the exact opposite the main axis runs vertically and the cross axix horizontaly.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Notice that if we shrink the width of the screen the flex items will shrink in width so that all of them fit into the available space. If we add more flex items their width will shrink to accomodate them all fitting on one line.This is the default behavior.
                    </p>

                    <div class="flexBoxContainer">
                        <div class="flexBoxItem one"> </div>
                        <div class="flexBoxItem two"> </div>
                        <div class="flexBoxItem three"> </div>
                        <div class="flexBoxItem four"> </div>
                        <div class="flexBoxItem five"> </div>
                        <div class="flexBoxItem six"> </div>
                        <div class="flexBoxItem seven"> </div>
                        <div class="flexBoxItem eight"> </div>
                        <div class="flexBoxItem "> </div>
                        <div class="flexBoxItem "> </div>
                        <div class="flexBoxItem "> </div>
                        <div class="flexBoxItem "> </div>
                        
                        
                    </div>
                    <br></br>
                     <p>
                        If we want to keep the flex items width and start on a new row, we add the flex-wrap property to wrap our Flex container. Each time there is no more room to fit another flexbox item on a row it will drop down and start a new row
                    </p>

                    <div class="flexBoxContainerB">
                        <div class="flexBoxItem one"> </div>
                        <div class="flexBoxItem two"> </div>
                        <div class="flexBoxItem three"> </div>
                        <div class="flexBoxItem four"> </div>
                        <div class="flexBoxItem five"> </div>
                        <div class="flexBoxItem six"> </div>
                        <div class="flexBoxItem seven"> </div>
                        <div class="flexBoxItem eight"> </div>
                        <div class="flexBoxItem "> </div>
                        <div class="flexBoxItem "> </div>
                        <div class="flexBoxItem "> </div>
                        <div class="flexBoxItem "> </div>
                        
                        
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        Now lets look at a column layout
                        <br></br>
                        <div class="flexBoxContainerC">
                        <div class="flexBoxItem one"> </div>
                        <div class="flexBoxItem two"> </div>
                        <div class="flexBoxItem three"> </div>
                        <div class="flexBoxItem four"> </div>
                        <div class="flexBoxItem five"> </div>
                        <div class="flexBoxItem six"> </div>
                        <div class="flexBoxItem seven"> </div>
                        <div class="flexBoxItem eight"> </div>
                        </div>

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Now the height of the flex items wil shrink according to the size of the container just as the width did with a row layout.Lets add the flex-wrap property again and we will see that the flexitems maintain the height we assigned them and will form a new column when there is no more space along the main axis
                    </p>
                    <div class="flexBoxContainerD">
                        <div class="flexBoxItem one"> </div>
                        <div class="flexBoxItem two"> </div>
                        <div class="flexBoxItem three"> </div>
                        <div class="flexBoxItem four"> </div>
                        <div class="flexBoxItem five"> </div>
                        <div class="flexBoxItem six"> </div>
                        <div class="flexBoxItem seven"> </div>
                        <div class="flexBoxItem eight"> </div>
                        
                    </div>

                     
                        <article><h3>
                            Justify content and align items
                        </h3> 
                        <p>
                        The 2 main properties that we can assign to our flexbox container to manipulate the layout of our flex items are justify content and align items.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Remember we talked about the main axis and the cross axis earlier. In a row layout the justify content property  will align the flex items along the main axis or horizontally. The align items property will align the items accross the cross axis. If the flex direction is set to column this be be the opposite justify content will align the items accross the main axis which in this case will be vertically and the align items property will align the items horizontally.
                          </p>
                        <p>
                            The justify-content property aligns the flexible container's items when the items do not use all available space on the main-axis (horizontally).
                         </p>

                           The align content property aligns multi-line content along the cross axis.

                         <h3>
                            flex-grow;flex-shrink and flex-basis
                         </h3>
                         <p>
                        We looked at assigning properties to our flex container to align the flex items, now lets look at some properties thatwe can assign to the flex items themselves.
                        The flex grow property sets the rate of growth for the flex elements. Notice that by default they will not take up all of the avaialble space in the flex container
                        </p>

                         <div class="flexBoxContainerE">
                        <div class="flexBoxItem one"> </div>
                        <div class="flexBoxItem two"> </div>
                        <div class="flexBoxItem three"> </div>
                        
                        
                    </div>
                    <h3>flex-grow</h3>

                    If we set the flex property to grow the flex items will grow to occupy the available space in the flex container.Lets apply the flex-grow property to our flexbox items.
                    <div class="flexBoxContainerE">
                        <div class="flexBoxItem grow"> </div>
                        <div class="flexBoxItem grow"> </div>
                        <div class="flexBoxItem grow"> </div>

                
                    </div>
                    <p>
                       We can also set the flex-grow property and value to each individual item.The flex-grow property value assigned specifies how much the item will grow relative to the rest of the flexible items inside the same container. for example an item with a flex grow value of 2 will be allocated 2 times as much room to grow as an item with a value of 1.
                    </p>
                    <h3>flex-shrink</h3>
                    <p>
                        The flex-shrink property specifies how the item will shrink relative to the rest of the flexible items inside the same container. The default is that all items shrink equally but we can set different flex-shrink values to each item just as with flex-grow.
                    </p>
                    <h3>
                        flex-basis
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        The flex-basis property defines the size of the flex-item along the main axis of the flex container. The main axis is horizontal if flex-direction is set to row and it’ll be vertical if the flex-direction property is set to column.
                    </p>

                    <h1>Flex shorthand</h1>
                    <p>
                        The flex property alone on a flex item is the shorthand for flex-grow, flex-shrink and flex-basis. The second and third parameters (flex-shrink and flex-basis) are optional.
                    </p>
                    
                    Have a play with these properties to familiarise ourselves with their effects.

                    <h1>Grid</h1>
                    <p>
                        Grid is similar to Flexbox and shares some of the same properties. Like Flexbox it uses a parent container which in turn holds the child elements. We can also add properties to the Grid container to affect both the gids layout and the layout of the child elements within the grid.Grid howebver lets us layout our elements in 2 dimensions instead of just one. Lets create a div of grid container and set the display to grid and 3 child elements.We wil also style them with a border and background-color to make them visible.
                    </p>
                    <div class="gridContainer">
                        <div class="gridElement"><h1>Grid Element 1</h1></div>
                        <div class="gridElement"><h1>Grid Element 2</h1></div>
                        <div class="gridElement"><h1>Grid Element 3</h1></div>
                        
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        Notice that alone the property grid doesn't have any effect on the layout.
                    </p>
                    
                        <h3>Grid columns and grid rows</h3>
                        <p>
                            The  main property we will use to layout our child elements is grid-layout. We need to define specific columns or rows for our grid. To do this we use the property grid-template.Lets define our columns first; we do this with the proerty grid-template-columns followed by setting the explicit size or ratio of each column.For example if we set grid-template-columns: 100px 200px it would create two columns, one with a width of 100px and the other with a width of 200px. If you want the elements to use all of the avaiable space in your container we would assign the sizes as % or as fr or fraction.fr works the same way as flexgrow in flexbox. Lets look at an example where we assign 3 columns widths of 2frpx,3fr and 5fr respectivly.
                            
                            
                            

                        
                        </p>
                         <div class="gridContainerB">
                        <div class="gridElement 1"><h1>Grid Element 1</h1></div>
                        <div class="gridElement 2"><h1>Grid Element 2</h1></div>
                        <div class="gridElement 3"><h1>Grid Element 3</h1></div>
                        <div class="gridElement 4"><h1>Grid Element 4</h1></div>
                    </div>

                    <p>
                        We can define our rows as well now. If we dont define our row the height of the grid element will be determined by the content it contains and the grid container will in turn be defined by height of the grid row. We define our rows the exact same way using the grid-template-rows property.
                    </p>
                     <div class="gridContainerC">
                        <div class="gridElement 1"><h1>Grid Element 1</h1></div>
                        <div class="gridElement 2"><h1>Grid Element 2</h1></div>
                        <div class="gridElement 3"><h1>Grid Element 3</h1></div>
                        <div class="gridElement 4"><h1>Grid Element 4</h1></div>
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        In the above example we gave our rows a heightof 150px and 250 px respectivly. So now we have 3 columns and 2 rows and our grid items are laid out in our grid container according to the parameters we set. We can also set grid-auto-row which will assign any row that isnt already defined a set height. So any further row created when we add more grid items will be whatever height we asssigned to grid-auto-row.
                    </p>
                    <h3>
                        min-max
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        As you can see if we dont define the height of a grid row it will be governed by the content it contains.It will stretch accordingly to fit the content.If we atribute a height to our rows or an auto row, any content that takes up more space that the grid items height will spill over. This is where min-max comes in. We can give grid-auto-rows the min-max property and assign a min(the first value) of 150px and the max to auto so it will still stretch to accomodate its content.the syntax is as follows grid-auto-rows: min-max(150px ,auto);
                    </p>

                    <h3>
                        row-gap; column-gap
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        The row-gap property specifies the size of the gap between the grid rows.The row-gap property was formerly known as grid-row-gap.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The column-gap CSS property sets the size of the gap (gutter) between an element's columns.
                    </p>
                    <p> grid-gap property will set both the column and row gaps
                    </p>
                    <h3>
                        grid-template-area
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        We can also layout our grid items using the property grid-template-areas.We do this by first assigning grid-template-areas to our grid-container. We can assign a string value for each area we want to define. For example if we had a 3 column layout and we wanted the header row to stretch accross all 3 columns we would assign "header header header" as one of the grid template areas.Then if we assigned the header property to a grid item, item 1 for example it would take up all of the area defined by grid-template area.Think of grid-template area as the frame,which you can specify its dimensions, then you stretch the grid utem over it like an elastic band over the grid points in the grid-template-area 
                        <br></br>
                        You can further define row and columns.Here is an example
                        using grid-template-areas: header header header      
                                                   content content sidebar    
                                                   content content sidebar             

                        Then we set the grid items to the items that we want them to correspond to. We can see if we set gridElement 1 to header item1 will take up the entire first row in our grid. If we set item 2 to content the item will take up all of the surface area in our grid that we have assigned a value content.And if we set item 3 to have a value of sidebar it ill take up all of the area assigned to side bar.
                        
                        <h3>grid-column-start; grid-column-end;grid-row start;grid row end</h3>
                        <p>
                            We can also define the space our grid items wil span by using the grid-column-start and grid-column end properties on the grid items. We assign to our grid item the column that it should start on, so if we set grid item 1 grid-column start: 1; grid-column-end:4; it will span the whole 3 columns. We can also do this for the rows with grid-row-start and grid-row-end.Note that grid-column end -1 will also span the whole row.
                            We can abbreviate this even more by using the grid-column or grid-row property and assigning a numerical value for the start and end seperated by a / ie grid-column:1/4; or grid-column:1/-1

                        </p>

                        <h3>
                            span
                        </h3>
                        <p>
                            Another way that we can define the area that our grid items occupy by using the span property on our grid items.This syntax wise is the simplest property. We simple assign the propert of span to ur gid item ans specify the number of columns or rows we want to span. ie
                            .gridElment 2{
                                grid-row:span 2;
                                
                            }

                            
                        </p>
                        <h3>
                             align and justify content
                        </h3>

                        <p>When working with grid layout you have two axes available to align things against the block or column axis and the inline or row axis. The block axis is the axis upon which blocks are laid out in block layout. If you have two paragraphs on your page they display one below the other, so it is this direction we describe as the block axis.<br></br>
                            We can justify and align both our grid container and our grid items within our container.This is similar to how we justify and align in flexbox.<br></br>
                            To align our grid container along the inline axis we set the property of justify-content to center.Below is a list of the different values we can set. 
                            <h1>
                            Property Values

                                <th>Description</th>
                             </tr>
                             <tr>
                                <td>start</td>
                                <td>Default value. Items are positioned at the beginning of the container</td>
                             </tr>
                             <tr>

                                </td>

                             <tr>
                                <td>space-around</td>
                                <td>Items will have space before, between, and after them

                                <td>Items will have equal space around them</td>
                             </tr>
                             <tr>
                                <td>initial</td>
                                <td>Sets this property to its default value.</td>
                             </tr>
                             <tr>
                                <td>inherit</td>
                                <td>Inherits this property from its parent element.</td>
                            </tr>
                         </table>

                         To align our grid container along the block or column axis we use the align-content property and set its value accordingly. Remember that in order to do this we mus have set a height to our grid container.

                    <h3>justify and align items </h3>
                    <p>
                    We looked at how we can justify and align the actual container.Now we will justify and align the actual grid items within the container. To do this we use the properties justify-items and align-items. We will aslo use the block/column or inline/row axes.The default for both is stretch. Just as with flexbox this will align the actual grid items position within our grid containers rows and columns. 
                    </p>
                    <h3>
                        Align self
                    </h3>
                      <p>
                        Just as with flexbox we can override the alignment that we have assigned to our items in our grid container by assigning the align-self property to an specific grid item/s
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Have a play with the different values  to get familiar with them. Using grid containers for page layout and then placing flex containers within the grid items is a very popular way of laying out a website.
