      <p>
        Javascript is a programming launguage;a scripting programming language.
        A scripting programming or script language is a programming language
        that is used to manipulate, customize, and automate the facilities of an
        existing system such as in a web browser or web or mobile app.We can use it to make calculations, perform logic, interact with data. Javascript is an object orientated launguage

         <h1>
         Some Javascript use cases
         </h1>
      <h1>
        Create dynamic webpages
      </h1>
        JavaScript allows users to interact with web pages.We can use JS to identify and interact with any object in our DOM.We can use JS to listen to events or user inputs such as cutton clicks and react to those inputs. Use JS to perform actions based on logic. For example check if a user is logged in or not;or is a member  to control access to pages etc;Make filling out certain info manadtory. We can set almost any stipulation  such as if something happens, when a condition is met or not met.  There are almost no limits to the things you can do with JavaScript on a web page – these
        are just a few examples: <ul>
             <li>
              Show or hide elements or information with the click of a button. 
             </li>
             <li>
              Validate form data;
             </li>
             <li>
              Perform logical comparisons
             </li>
             <li>
              Change the color of a button when the mouse hovers over it.
             </li>
             <li>
              Slide through a carousel of images on the homepage.
             </li>
             <li>
              Zooming in or zooming out on an image
             </li>
             <li>
              Displaying a timer or count-down on a website
             </li>
             <li>
              display promts or alerts
             </li>
             
             <li>
              Creating web and mobile apps
             </li>
             </ul> 
            
             Developers can use various JavaScript frameworks for
             developing and building web and mobile apps. JavaScript frameworks are
             collections of JavaScript code libraries that provide developers with
             pre-written code to use for routine programming features and
             tasks—literally a framework to build websites or web applications
             around. Popular JavaScript front-end frameworks include React, React
             Native, Angular, and Vue. Express.js, or simply Express, is a back end web application framework for building RESTful APIs with Node.js
             
             It can be used to create interactive and dynamic web pages.Some examples are identifying and manipulating objects
             in our DOM; listen for and identify events such as user inputs,form
             processing and validation,interacting with 3d party databases,create and
             interact with our apps backend, creating http endpoints. Building web
             servers and developing server applications We can make http requests to
             APIs via various methods such as FETCH, AJAX,JQUERY and cretate our own
             APIs to handle requests. developers can use JavaScript to build simple
             web servers and develop the back-end infrastructure using Node.js.

                Node JS
              </h3>
              <p>
                If we talk about any application then the part with which the user is interacting is basically the frontend of our website whereas there are many things which happen in the background or in the backend of our website. Basically there are three parts of any application, one is Frontend with which the users are interacting, then comes to the backend server and backend database. For backend servers we can use NodeJS, Java, Python, etc. and for backend databases we use relational or non-relational databases.

                Node is a runtime environment that lets us run JS outside of a browser



                Whenever a client requests something from the client side of the application what happens is , the request is first sent to the server and then in that server some processing or calculations goes on for the validation of the client side request and after doing all such validation a response is sent to the client side. Basically for doing all such calculations and processing , this NodeJs framework of JavaScript is used.

              ExpressJS is a web application framework for NodeJS. That’s what mainly makes the difference between Express JS and Node JS. The former provides various features that make web application development fast and easy, which otherwise takes more time using only the latter. It provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.

              Use Cases of Express JS
              ExpressJS is a great solution for small to medium-sized applications because it is lightweight and very easy to implement. The framework also provides a wide range of use cases such as:

REST APIs:
ExpressJS has been built to support the building of REST APIs, which are one of the most common ways for servers to exchange data with clients.
